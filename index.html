      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'd love to have basical understanding of coding whether I become a professional programmer or the others. I want to figure it out what is going on behind the website we see everyday. I believe making our daily lives easier can be started and achieved by learning coding.</p>
